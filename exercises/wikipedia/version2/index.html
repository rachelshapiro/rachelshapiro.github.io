            <p>An aurora, also known as the polar lights or aurora polaris, is a natural light display in Earth's sky, predominantly seen in high-latitude regions (around the Arctic and Antarctic). Auroras display dynamic patterns of brilliant lights that appear as curtains, rays, spirals, or dynamic flickers covering the entire sky.</p>
            <p>Auroras are the result of disturbances in the magnetosphere caused by solar wind. These disturbances alter the trajectories of charged particles in the magnetospheric plasma. These particles, mainly electrons and protons, precipitate into the upper atmosphere (thermosphere/exosphere). The resulting ionization and excitation of atmospheric constituents emit light of varying colour and complexity. The form of the aurora, occurring within bands around both polar regions, is also dependent on the amount of acceleration imparted to the precipitating particles.</p>
            <p>Most of the planets in the Solar System, some natural satellites, brown dwarfs, and even comets also host auroras.</p>
            <p>The word "aurora" is derived from the name of the Roman goddess of the dawn, Aurora, who travelled from east to west announcing the coming of the sun. Ancient Greek poets used the name metaphorically to refer to dawn, often mentioning its play of colors across the otherwise dark sky</p>

		<h3>Occurence</h3>
		<div class="o1">
		   <p>Most auroras occur in a band known as the "auroral zone", which is typically 3째 to 6째 wide in latitude and between 10째 and 20째 longitudes, most clearly seen at night against a dark sky. A region that currently displays an aurora is called the "auroral oval", a band displaced by the solar wind towards the night side of Earth. Early evidence for a geomagnetic connection comes from the statistics of auroral observations.

		   <p>In northern latitudes, the effect is known as the <div class="aurora">aurora borealis</div> or the <div class="aurora">northern lights</div>. The former term was coined by Galileo in 1619. The southern counterpart, the aurora Australis or the southern lights, has features almost identical to the aurora borealis. The aurora Australis is visible from high southern latitudes in Antarctica, Chile, Argentina, South Africa, New Zealand, and Australia. The aurora borealis is visible from being close to the center of the Arctic Circle such as Alaska, Canada, Iceland, Greenland, Norway, Sweden, Finland and Russia.</p>

		   <p>A geomagnetic storm causes the auroral ovals (north and south) to expand, bringing the aurora to lower latitudes. The auroral arcs reach furthest toward the equator when the magnetic pole is in between the observer and the Sun. The aurora can be seen best at this time, which is called magnetic midnight.</p>
