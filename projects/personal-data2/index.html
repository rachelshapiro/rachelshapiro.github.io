	"I tend to use my phone most as a way to procrastinate or distract myself from things that I dont want to be doing. Unexpectedly, my days with the most screen-time were weekdays when I tend to be busier and most of my phone time is spent talking with other people or on social media. My phone connects me to a larger world but also pulls me out of real world."
