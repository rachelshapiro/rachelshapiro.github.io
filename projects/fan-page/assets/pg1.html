		<p><li>Out of the nine days, three of the days the first video on my for you page was geared towards my college age students or people in their early 20s (Day 3, Day 6, and Day 8)</li></p>
		<p><li>When  my algorithm started with these videos I stayed on TikTok for an average 30 minutes each time (longer than my average scroll)</li></p>
		<p><li>These creators were ones that tended to appear on my "For You Page" frequently and I had seen in the past</li></p>
		<p><li>These videos all appeared when I opened TikTok in the morning, but not in the afternoon</li></p>
